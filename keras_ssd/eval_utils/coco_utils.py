    '''
    Builds dictionaries that map between MS COCO category IDs, transformed category IDs, and category names.
    The original MS COCO category IDs are not consecutive unfortunately: The 80 category IDs are spread
    across the integers 1 through 90 with some integers skipped. Since we usually use a one-hot
    class representation in neural networks, we need to map these non-consecutive original COCO category
    IDs (let's call them 'cats') to consecutive category IDs (let's call them 'classes').

    Arguments:
        annotations_file (str): The filepath to any MS COCO annotations JSON file.

    Returns:
        1) cats_to_classes: A dictionary that maps between the original (keys) and the transformed category IDs (values).
        2) classes_to_cats: A dictionary that maps between the transformed (keys) and the original category IDs (values).
        3) cats_to_names: A dictionary that maps between original category IDs (keys) and the respective category names (values).
        4) classes_to_names: A list of the category names (values) with their indices representing the transformed IDs.

    '''
    Runs detection predictions over the whole dataset given a model and saves them in a JSON file
    in the MS COCO detection results format.

    Arguments:
        out_file (str): The file name (full path) under which to save the results JSON file.
        model (Keras model): A Keras SSD model object.
        img_height (int): The input image height for the model.
        img_width (int): The input image width for the model.
        classes_to_cats (dict): A dictionary that maps the consecutive class IDs predicted by the model
            to the non-consecutive original MS COCO category IDs.
        data_generator (DataGenerator): A `DataGenerator` object with the evaluation dataset.
        batch_size (int): The batch size for the evaluation.
        data_generator_mode (str, optional): Either of 'resize' or 'pad'. If 'resize', the input images will
            be resized (i.e. warped) to `(img_height, img_width)`. This mode does not preserve the aspect ratios of the images.
            If 'pad', the input images will be first padded so that they have the aspect ratio defined by `img_height`
            and `img_width` and then resized to `(img_height, img_width)`. This mode preserves the aspect ratios of the images.
        model_mode (str, optional): The mode in which the model was created, i.e. 'training', 'inference' or 'inference_fast'.
            This is needed in order to know whether the model output is already decoded or still needs to be decoded. Refer to
            the model documentation for the meaning of the individual modes.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in a specific
            positive class in order to be considered for the non-maximum suppression stage for the respective class.
            A lower value will result in a larger part of the selection process being done by the non-maximum suppression
            stage, while a larger value will result in a larger part of the selection process happening in the confidence
            thresholding stage.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): A float in [0,1]. All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold`
            with a locally maximal box will be removed from the set of predictions for a given class, where 'maximal' refers
            to the box score.
        top_k (int, optional): The number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item after the
            non-maximum suppression stage. Defaults to 200, following the paper.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height), 'minmax' for the format
            `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`.

    Returns:
        None.
