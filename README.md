# Keras RetinaNet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fizyr/keras-retinanet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fizyr/keras-retinanet) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/100249425.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/100249425)

Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)
by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) Ensure numpy is installed using `pip install numpy --user`
3) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
4) Alternatively, you can run the code directly from the cloned  repository, however you need to run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython code first.
5) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`.

## Testing
An example of testing the network can be seen in [this Notebook](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/ResNet50RetinaNet.ipynb).
In general, inference of the network works as follows:
```python
boxes, scores, labels = model.predict_on_batch(inputs)
```

Where `boxes` are shaped `(None, None, 4)` (for `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`), scores is shaped `(None, None)` (classification score) and labels is shaped `(None, None)` (label corresponding to the score). In all three outputs, the first dimension represents the shape and the second dimension indexes the list of detections.

Loading models can be done in the following manner:
```python
from keras_retinanet.models import load_model
model = load_model('/path/to/model.h5', backbone_name='resnet50')
```

Execution time on NVIDIA Pascal Titan X is roughly 75msec for an image of shape `1000x800x3`.

### Converting a training model to inference model
The training procedure of `keras-retinanet` works with *training models*. These are stripped down versions compared to the *inference model* and only contains the layers necessary for training (regression and classification values). If you wish to do inference on a model (perform object detection on an image), you need to convert the trained model to an inference model. This is done as follows:

```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/convert_model.py /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-convert-model /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5
```

Most scripts (like `retinanet-evaluate`) also support converting on the fly, using the `--convert-model` argument.


## Training
`keras-retinanet` can be trained using [this](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/train.py) script.
Note that the train script uses relative imports since it is inside the `keras_retinanet` package.
If you want to adjust the script for your own use outside of this repository,
you will need to switch it to use absolute imports.

If you installed `keras-retinanet` correctly, the train script will be installed as `retinanet-train`.
However, if you make local modifications to the `keras-retinanet` repository, you should run the script directly from the repository.
That will ensure that your local changes will be used by the train script.

The default backbone is `resnet50`. You can change this using the `--backbone=xxx` argument in the running script.
`xxx` can be one of the backbones in resnet models (`resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnet152`), mobilenet models (`mobilenet128_1.0`, `mobilenet128_0.75`, `mobilenet160_1.0`, etc), densenet models or vgg models. The different options are defined by each model in their corresponding python scripts (`resnet.py`, `mobilenet.py`, etc).

Trained models can't be used directly for inference. To convert a trained model to an inference model, check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model).

### Usage
For training on [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:

```

For training on Open Images Dataset [OID](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
or taking place to the [OID challenges](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/challenge.html), run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-train oid /path/to/OID

# You can also specify a list of labels if you want to train on a subset
# by adding the argument 'labels_filter':
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --labels-filter=Helmet,Tree

# You can also specify a parent label if you want to train on a branch
# from the semantic hierarchical tree (i.e a parent and all children)
(https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/challenge_2018/bbox_labels_500_hierarchy_visualizer/circle.html)
# by adding the argument 'parent-label':
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --parent-label=Boat
```


For training on [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php), run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py kitti /path/to/KITTI

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-train kitti /path/to/KITTI

If you want to prepare the dataset you can use the following script:
https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/examples/object-detection/prepare_kitti_data.py
```


For training on a [custom dataset], a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data.
See below for more details on the format of these CSV files.
To train using your CSV, run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-train csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes
```

In general, the steps to train on your own datasets are:
1) Create a model by calling for instance `keras_retinanet.models.backbone('resnet50').retinanet(num_classes=80)` and compile it.
   Empirically, the following compile arguments have been found to work well:
```python
model.compile(
    loss={
        'regression'    : keras_retinanet.losses.smooth_l1(),
        'classification': keras_retinanet.losses.focal()
    },
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.adam(lr=1e-5, clipnorm=0.001)
)
```
2) Create generators for training and testing data (an example is show in [`keras_retinanet.preprocessing.pascal_voc.PascalVocGenerator`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/preprocessing/pascal_voc.py)).
3) Use `model.fit_generator` to start training.

## CSV datasets
The `CSVGenerator` provides an easy way to define your own datasets.
It uses two CSV files: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping.

### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

Some images may not contain any labeled objects.
To add these images to the dataset as negative examples,
add an annotation where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `class_name` are all empty:
```
path/to/image.jpg,,,,,
```

A full example:
```
/data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,22,5,89,84,bird
/data/imgs/img_003.jpg,,,,,
```

This defines a dataset with 3 images.
`img_001.jpg` contains a cow.
`img_002.jpg` contains a cat and a bird.
`img_003.jpg` contains no interesting objects/animals.


### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
bird,2
```

## Anchor optimization

In some cases, the default anchor configuration is not suitable for detecting objects in your dataset, for example, if your objects are smaller than the 32x32px (size of the smallest anchors). In this case, it might be suitable to modify the anchor configuration, this can be done automatically by following the steps in the [anchor-optimization](https://github.com/martinzlocha/anchor-optimization/) repository. To use the generated configuration check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet-test-data/blob/master/config/config.ini) for an example config file and then pass it to `train.py` using the `--config` parameter.

## Debugging
Creating your own dataset does not always work out of the box. There is a [`debug.py`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/debug.py) tool to help find the most common mistakes.

Particularly helpful is the `--annotations` flag which displays your annotations on the images from your dataset. Annotations are colored in green when there are anchors available and colored in red when there are no anchors available. If an annotation doesn't have anchors available, it means it won't contribute to training. It is normal for a small amount of annotations to show up in red, but if most or all annotations are red there is cause for concern. The most common issues are that the annotations are too small or too oddly shaped (stretched out).

### Discussions
Feel free to join the `#keras-retinanet` [Keras Slack](https://keras-slack-autojoin.herokuapp.com/) channel for discussions and questions.

## FAQ
* **I get the warning `UserWarning: No training configuration found in save file: the model was not compiled. Compile it manually.`, should I be worried?** This warning can safely be ignored during inference.
* **I get the error `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)` during inference, what to do?**. This is because you are using a train model to do inference. See https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model for more information.
* **How do I do transfer learning?** The easiest solution is to use the `--weights` argument when training. Keras will load models, even if the number of classes don't match (it will simply skip loading of weights when there is a mismatch). Run for example `retinanet-train --weights snapshots/some_coco_model.h5 pascal /path/to/pascal` to transfer weights from a COCO model to a PascalVOC training session. If your dataset is small, you can also use the `--freeze-backbone` argument to freeze the backbone layers.
* **How do I change the number / shape of the anchors?** The train tool allows to pass a configuration file, where the anchor parameters can be adjusted. Check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet-test-data/blob/master/config/config.ini) for an example config file.
* **I get a loss of `0`, what is going on?** This mostly happens when none of the anchors "fit" on your objects, because they are most likely too small or elongated. You can verify this using the [debug](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#debugging) tool.
* **I have an older model, can I use it after an update of keras-retinanet?** This depends on what has changed. If it is a change that doesn't affect the weights then you can "update" models by creating a new retinanet model, loading your old weights using `model.load_weights(weights_path, by_name=True)` and saving this model. If the change has been too significant, you should retrain your model (you can try to load in the weights from your old model when starting training, this might be a better starting position than ImageNet).
* **I get the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras_retinanet.utils.compute_overlap'`, how do I fix this?** Most likely you are running the code from the cloned repository. This is fine, but you need to compile some extensions for this to work (`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`).
* **How do I train on my own dataset?** The steps to train on your dataset are roughly as follows:
* 1. Prepare your dataset in the CSV format (a training and validation split is advised).
* 2. Check that your dataset is correct using `retinanet-debug`.
* 3. Train retinanet, preferably using the pretrained COCO weights (this gives a **far** better starting point, making training much quicker and accurate). You can optionally perform evaluation of your validation set during training to keep track of how well it performs (advised).
* 4. Convert your training model to an inference model.
* 5. Evaluate your inference model on your test or validation set.
* 6. Profit!
